### Part that I have changed
- Support for display of face icon
- The follow-up to the width of the content
- Change the color tone
- The face icon on the left side, the balloon on the right

thank you.

## usage
 - Add to Blog by modifying appropriate style.css
 - describe the background-image the url and you have something of any face icon
 - write your comment in the div.comment_inner tags: code.html

## Tips for TextExpander users

```
<h3>Comment</h3>
<div class="comment_outer">
<div class="comment_inner">%|</div>
</div>
```

I think if more convenient if you register as a code snippet, the caret is moved in the div.comment_inner tag.
